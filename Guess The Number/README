This is an android app. It is a game that you have 5 tries to guess a number between [1,99].When you try to guess the number,you get messages that tell you if the number you are trying to guess is higher or lower for the number you had already give.If you dont guess the number in 5 tries,you can restart the game and play again.

I wrote this program for "Mobile Networks and Mobile App development" course.
