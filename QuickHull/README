A program written in JAVA that implements a problem solution using QuickHull algorithm.

You must choose the sortest path to go from an initial state to a marked state.

In this problem you have to pass a field full of landmines to reach the treasure chest, and you can not go between them. You must pass around anc reach the goal at the shortest path.

I wrote this program for "Algorithms" course.
